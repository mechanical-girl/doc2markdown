======
Karelia is a library of functions for connecting a bot to the Heim chat
platform at euphoria.io

Syntax
------
###changeNick
`changeNick(nick = botName)
    `: 
changeNick sends the `nick` command to Heim servers.

If a nick is passed in as an argument, it will change to that and change
the `botName` variable to the value passed as an argument (for resilience
against `!antighost`, amongst other reasons). If no nick is specified, it
will assume that the `botName` variable is the desired nick.

###getUptime
`getUptime()
    `: 
Called by the `!uptime` command. Returns time since connect as string.

###send
`send(message, parent = '', packet = False)
    `: 
Sends the supplied message. The parent message can be specified.

Arguments are: the message to be sent, the id of the parent message, the
packet being replied to, and whether or not message is a complete packet.

- message:  either a complete packet, or the `['data']['content']` field
of one. If the former, the packet argument must be set to true.
- parent:   the id of the message being replied to. If not specified,
karelia will send the message as a new parent i.e. bottom-level message.
- packet:   if set to `True`, the first argument will be treated as a
complete packet.

`karelia.send('Top-level message')` will send that as a top-level message.

`karelia.send('It's a reply!','02aa8y85m7hts')` will send that message as
a reply to the message with id `02aa8y85m7hts`.

`karelia.send({'type': 'log', 'data': {'n':1000}}, True)` will send a log
request for the thousand most recent messages posted to the room.

###connectTo
`connectTo(roomName)
    `: 
Connects to specified room and sets nick. Returns a connection object.

###disconnect
`disconnect(conn)
    `: 
Attempts to close the connection passed to it.

###parse
`parse(packet = False, name = False)
    `: 
parse() handles the commands specified in the Botrulez
(github.com/jedevc/botrulez) and those required to stay alive.

parse() is a blocking function - that is, it will always wait until it
receives a packet from heim before returning.

On receiving a packet, it will reply to pings (both global and specific,
offer uptime, pause and unpause the bot, respond to help requests (again,
both global and local) and antighost commands, and kills the bot.

Regardless of actions taken, it will return the unaltered packet. If an
error occurs, it will return an exception.

Note: as of 2017-03-16 if killed, it will return sys.exit().

###spoof
`spoof(packet, spoofBot)
    `: 
spoof() takes two arguments (packet and spoofBot)

Calling spoof(packet, spoofBot) causes karelia to respond to the packet
offered as though it were named spoofBot.

###log
`log(error = '', message = '')
    `: 
logs as much information as possible to an external file.

log should be passed an exception object and if possible the message being
processed at the time of the exception. It will then write out as much as
it can about the exception to a logfile.
